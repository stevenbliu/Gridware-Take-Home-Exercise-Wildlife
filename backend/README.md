⚠️ Scalability Challenges You're Facing
Data Type	Estimated Volume	Bottleneck	Symptom
Herds	~100s	Low impact	Simple reads
Families	~100K–500K	Join + foreign key scan	Family queries slow
Observations	Millions+	No time/geo partitioning	Slow /api/families/{id}/...
Events	100Ks–Millions	No spatial index	Slow "what happened near X"

Improvements:
1. ✅ PostgreSQL with PostGIS
Upgrade from raw lat/lng float to true geospatial support.

Why?
PostGIS gives you:

Fast radius queries (ST_DWithin)

Spatial indexes (GIST)

Built-in distance filters (ST_Distance)

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_obs_geo ON observations USING GIST (geography(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)));

2. ✅ Indexing Strategy
Apply these indexes to speed up filtering:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Observations
CREATE INDEX idx_obs_family_ts ON observations(family_id, ts);
CREATE INDEX idx_obs_ts ON observations(ts);
-- Events
CREATE INDEX idx_event_ts ON events(ts);
CREATE INDEX idx_event_geo ON events USING GIST (geography(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)));

3. ✅ Query Refactor: Efficient Endpoints
These 5 endpoints need optimized queries:

Question	Solution
Where has a Herd's families been?	Join Herd → Family → Observation (batch by family_id)
Where has a Family been?	Filter observations by family_id, ORDER BY ts
How has a Family's size/health changed?	SELECT ts, size, health_rating
What families were near (lat, long)?	Use ST_DWithin on observations
What events occurred near a location?	Use ST_DWithin on events table

All should:

Filter time range: WHERE ts >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

Paginate: LIMIT 500 OFFSET 0

Return lightweight DTOs for frontend maps

4. ✅ Partitioning Large Tables
Once observations or events exceed ~10M rows, partition by time (monthly):

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE observations (
  ...
  ts timestamp NOT NULL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (ts);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE observations_2025_05 PARTITION OF observations
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-05-01') TO ('2025-06-01');
5. ✅ Async + Caching
Use:

asyncpg or Databases for async DB access

Redis to cache:

Herd → Family map
